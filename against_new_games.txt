		[AGAINST NEW GAMES: TOWARDS A ROBUST VIDEOGAMING]

...	PREAMBLE

p.1	The state of videogames today is abysmal. While the gaming industry has 
	always been dominated by commercial concerns, there still remained room 
	for development teams to express themselves and their love for the 
	medium. This is no longer the case on any meaningful scale. The profit 
	motive has come to dominate in every aspect of game development with 
	publishers routinely participating in hostile, anti-consumer practices
 	[1] and unethical behavior present in every aspect of the industry. The
 	result is a standard of quality so unreliable [2], and general 
	expectation [3] of consumer exploitation so high, the only historical 
	comparison is the period immediately preceding the Videogame Crash of 
	1983 [4].

p.2	It's clear, too, that the industry's degrading view of its consumers 
	extends to the medium of videogames itself. While hobbyists have always 
	demonstrated a deep respect and love for the medium, the industry's 
	largest publishers make a routine habit [5][6] of destroying beloved 
	studios and franchises for momentary profits, and regularly employ anti-
	game practices [7] that limit their ability to be enjoyed in the long 
	term. The short-term perspective of the industry has lead to even 
	flagship titles [8][9][10] being treated as throwaways without lasting 
	value, designed with an expected lifespan of a single generation in 
	mind. Their marketing is instilled with this perspective, primarily 
	emphasizing graphical upgrades as the key selling point [11], despite 
	the fact they'll become outdated [12] in a few years, while the games 
	themselves remain uninnovative, each generation releasing [13] and re-
	releasing [14] the same titles in different skins.

p.3	The truth is, the technical returns of hardware are stagnating [15]. In 
	the past, the creative vision of developers was highly constrained [16] 
	by hardware capabilities before any other concerns, but this is no 
	longer the case. The technology is improving, but the games are only 
	getting prettier, not more complex, not better.

p.4	Is "pretty" really the reason we play videogames? Does it really justify 
	being trapped on this hardware treadmill? How many times will we have to 
	invest in system upgrades just to keep playing the same game? And 
	really, why should we?

...AGAINST NEW GAMES

1. GOOD GRAPHICS ARE UNIMPORTANT

  a.	In practice, good graphics means whatever is closest to photorealism 
	today. It's a relative, moving standard that becomes outdated every 
	generation: yesterday's realism is today's eyesore [17].
  b.	Photorealistic graphics is primarily a marketing gimmick [18]. It’s used 
	to sell every new generation of hardware, and important enough that the 
	industry often resorts to deceptive advertising [19][20].
  c.	The technical quality of graphics has little influence [21] on the 
	actual experience of play. The visual aspect of the game experience is 
	largely affected by its art design, not its graphical standard.
  d.	Emphasizing photorealism is a short-term decision. It looks good only in 
	the current generation, but ages poorly [22] in comparison to stylized 
	or abstracted visuals [23].
  e.	Achieving the contemporary standard of photorealism is expensive. The 
	drive for visual quality is the primary factor raising the cost of game 
	development [24]. The result is that game companies experience tighter 
	profit margins and are forced to limit design decisions to the market 
	conservative.

2. THE HARDWARE TREADMILL IS UNNECESSARY

  a. 	The hardware benefits to technical complexity have plateaued [25]. 
	Development will hit other ceilings long before they do a hardware 
	limitation.
  b. 	Consumers are forced to upgrade their hardware every generation to 
	continue playing new products, but this hardware treadmill does nothing 
	to contribute to gameplay [26]. The continuously rising hardware 
	standard now exists entirely to support every generation's new graphical 
	standard [27].
  c.	Developers could optimize for lower minimum hardware requirements [28] 
	and provide extensive end-user graphics configurability [29], but they 
	choose not to, forcing everyone to stay on the hardware treadmill to 
	continue playing new games. The exceptions prove the rule: Valve [30], 
	Blizzard [31] and Croteam [32] are studios well-known for their highly 
	optimized releases.

3. HARMFUL PRACTICE HAVE BECOME INDUSTRY STANDARDS

  a.	The industry as a whole increasingly employs consumer-hostile practices 
	in its publication and distribution, such as: 
	artificial exclusivity, centralized multiplayer servers, DRM, exclusive 
	content and pre-order bonuses, limited backwards compatibility, no LAN 
	multiplayer, no split-screen, console online subscriptions, P2W and 
	microtranscation models, paid DLC, subscription releases or seasonal 
	passes and vendor lock-in [33].
  b.	Even the indie industry, which has heavily commercialized over the last 
	decade, has begun to adopt some questionable practices, such as:
	closed source & non-free software, early access, crowdfunding and 
	paywalled content [34].
  c.	It is uncomfortable to participate in and unethical to support this 
	industry, and it will only change when consumers as a group reject it 	
	[35].

4. GOOD GAMES DON'T AGE

  a.	Good game design is eternal [36]. The best games of the past are all 
	just as rewarding to play today as they were at their release. This is 
	evidenced by the common practice of rereleasing older games [36].
  b.	Innovation in game design is less and less tied to innovation in 
	technology [37]. Any game made today could easily have been made 10 
	years ago once we discount graphics.
  c.	In the long-term, games are evaluated on the merits of their game design 
	[38], while the technical achievement of their graphics become 
	irrelevant [39].
  d. 	The near-complete historical library of video games [40] is readily 
	accessible through emulation [41]. A lifetime isn't enough to exhaust 
	the long list of highly regarded games [42].
  e.	The majority of games of every generation will be forgettable [43], and 
	conversely, only the worthwhile ones will be remembered. There is little 
	reason to bother sifting through today's trash when you can play 
	yesterday's gems.

...ROBUST VIDEOGAMING: A MANIFESTO

1.   REJECT GRAPHICAL QUALITY AS AN INFLUENCE ON YOUR INTERPRETATION OF A GAME’S 
     VALUE.

2.   REJECT ANY GAME THAT CANNOT BE PLAYED ON INEXPENSIVE HARDWARE.

3.   REJECT ANY GAME THAT IS DESIGNED OR RELEASED WITH HARMFUL PRACTICES.

4.   CONFIGURE YOUR SYSTEM(S) TO MAKE FULL USE OF THE EMULATION OPTIONS              
     AVAILABLE.

5.   CONSIDER ALL NEW GAMES RELEASED TODAY ALONGSIDE ALL GAMES RELEASED IN THE 
     PAST, NOT ONLY IN THE ISOLATED CONTEXT OF THEIR OWN GENERATION.

6.   CONSIDER ALL NEW GAMES RELEASED TODAY FROM A LONG-TERM PERSPECTIVE. ASK 
     YOURSELF: IN 20 YEARS, WOULD I CHOOSE TO PLAY THIS GAME, OR THE 40 YEAR OLD 
     ONE?
