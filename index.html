<h2><a id="Preamble">Preamble</a></h2>
<p>The state of videogames today is abysmal. While the gaming industry has always been dominated by commercial concerns, there still remained room for development teams to express themselves and their love for the medium. This is no longer the case on any meaningful scale. The profit motive has come to dominate in every aspect of game development with publishers routinely participating in <a href="harmful_practices.html">hostile, anti-consumer practices</a> and unethical behavior present in every aspect of the industry. The result is a standard of quality so <a href="http://archive.is/vRRU7" title="The Deceptive Marketing of Video Games">unreliable</a>, and <a href="http://archive.is/nFrwW" title="How Do Video Game Publishers Continue To Get Away With Mistreating Their Customers?">general expectation</a> of consumer exploitation so high, the only historical comparison is the period immediately preceding the <a href="http://archive.is/t0Msf" title="Wikipedia, 'Videogame Crash of 1983'">Videogame Crash of 1983</a>. </p>

<p>It's clear, too, that the industry's degrading view of its consumers extends to the medium of videogames itself. While hobbyists have always demonstrated a deep respect and love for the medium<!-- (even if its consideration as 'art' is still debated)-->, the industry's largest publishers make a <a href="http://archive.is/Cgu4j" title="Studios EA Has Killed: A History">routine</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180215050639/http://www.gamesradar.com/exactly-how-many-studios-has-activision-closed-generation-exactly-many/" titles="Exactly how many studios has Activision actually closed this generation?">habit</a> of destroying beloved studios and franchises for momentary profits, and regularly employ <a href="harmful_practices.html">anti-game practices</a> that limit their ability to be enjoyed in the long term. The short-term perspective of the industry has lead to
  <a href="http://archive.is/H4l9y" title="KILLZONE 2 AND 3 SERVERS TO BE DECOMMISSIONED">even</a>
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181121012547/http://v1.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/132436-Gran-Tursimo-5-Servers-Go-Offline-DLC-Gone-Forever" title="Gran Tursimo 5 Servers Go Offline, DLC Gone Forever">flagship</a> <a href="http://archive.is/o9l7s" title="Monster Hunter Tri Servers Will be Shutdown">titles</a> being treated as throwaways without lasting value, designed with an expected lifespan of a single generation in mind. <!--Even if they weren't hampered to the point of unplayability by exploitative restrictions, they're not designed with any lasting value that would have them be remembered any time in the future.-->
Their marketing is instilled with this perspective, primarily emphasizing graphical upgrades as the <a href="http://archive.is/OzwlS" title="Research: The state of the video game industry in 2017">key selling point</a>, despite the fact they'll become <a href="https://invidio.us/watch?v=3H6hnFV-nDU" alt="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H6hnFV-nDU">outdated</a> in a few years, while the games themselves remain uninnovative, each generation <a href="http://archive.is/9yxhF" title="Sequelitis: Are sequels and reboots bad for the video game industry">releasing</a> and <a href="http://archive.is/IfkfO" title="Remakes, Remasters, and HD Collections by the Numbers">re-releasing</a> the same titles in different skins.</p>

<p>The truth is, the technical returns of hardware are <a href="http://archive.is/PAWyf">stagnating</a>. In the past, the creative vision of developers was highly <a href="http://archive.is/pHxN6" title="Bogost, Montfort, 'Racing the Beam'">constrained</a> by hardware capabilities before any other concerns, but this is no longer the case. The technology is improving, but the games are only getting prettier, not more complex, not better.</p>
<p>Is "pretty" really the reason we play videogames? Does it really justify being trapped on this hardware treadmill? How many times will we have to invest in system upgrades just to keep playing the same game? And really, why should we?</p>

<h3><a id="good_graphics"></a>1. Good Graphics Are Unimportant</h3>
<ol>
<li>In practice, good graphics means whatever is closest to photorealism <i>today</i>. It's a relative, moving standard that becomes outdated every generation: yesterday's realism is <a href="">today's eyesore</a>.</li>
<li>Photorealistic graphics is primarily a <a href="http://archive.is/7h4I5" title="Kate Russell, 'Exploring the Evolution of the Games Market'">marketing gimmick</a>. It’s used to sell every new generation of hardware, and important enough that the industry often resorts to <a href="http://archive.is/wjWZJ" title="Sony sued for 'deceptive marketing' of Killzone: Shadow Fall graphics">deceptive</a> <a href="http://archive.is/h7AEH" title="Gearbox and Sega falsely advertised Aliens: Colonial Marines with press demos, according to lawsuit">advertising</a>.</li>
<li>The technical quality of graphics has <a href="http://archive.is/zqXZt" title="Jesper Juul, 'A Certain Level of Abstraction'">little influence</a> on the actual experience of play. The visual aspect of the game experience is largely affected by its art design, not its graphical standard.</li>
<li>Emphasizing photorealism is a short-term decision. It looks good only in the current generation, but <a href="http://archive.is/wGKIT" title="Photorealism versus Non­Photorealism: Art styles in computer games and the default bias">ages poorly</a> in comparison to <a href="http://archive.is/Ef9ef" title="Holly Nielsen, 'On Ōkami at Ten Years Old: the Quintessential Ageless Video Game'
">stylized or abstracted visuals</a>.</li>
<!-- <li>Emphasis on good graphics is responsible for the elimination of local multiplayer due to the cost of re-rendering visuals on multiple screens. This artificially reduces the lifespan of a game, hurts videogaming's social factor and limits the ability to play with friends to only those who own the same game and system.</li> -->
<li>Achieving the contemporary standard of photorealism is expensive. The drive for visual quality is the primary factor <a href="http://archive.is/6UoNi" title="Tom McShea, 'Beauty Is in the Eye of the Destroyer'">raising the cost of game development</a>. The result is that game companies experience tighter profit margins and are forced to limit design decisions to the market conservative.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a id="hardware_treadmill"></a>2. The Hardware Treadmill Is Unnecessary</h3>
<ol>
<li>The hardware benefits to technical complexity <a href="http://archive.is/LjeC5" title"Andrew Hutchison, Making the Water Move: Techno-Historic Limits in the Game Aesthetics of Myst and Doom">have plateaued</a>. Development will hit other ceilings long before they do a hardware limitation.</li>
<li>Consumers are forced to upgrade their hardware every generation to continue playing new products, but this hardware treadmill does nothing to <a href="http://archive.is/T2ych" title="Dave Thier, 'The Nintendo Switch's Secret Is That It's Already Obsolete'">contribute to gameplay</a>. The continuously rising hardware standard now exists <a href="">entirely</a> to support every generation's new graphical standard.</li>
<li>Developers could optimize for <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/139411097" title="Ryan Greene, 'Optimizing Overwatch for a Wide Range of Graphics'">lower minimum hardware requirements</a> and provide extensive end-user <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190131192333/https://imgur.com/a/1MWxi/all" title="The Talos Principle Graphic Settings">graphics configurability</a>, but they choose not to, forcing everyone to stay on the hardware treadmill to continue playing new games. The exceptions prove the rule: <a href="">Valve</a>, <a href="http://archive.is/MKio6" title="22 percent of Overwatch players use integrated graphics">Blizzard</a> and <a href="http://archive.is/mYub7" title="Reddit Forum Discussion, 'Every PC game should have graphics options like The Talos Principle.'">Croteam</a> are studios well-known for their highly optimized releases.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a id="harmful_practices"></a>3. Harmful Practices Have Become Industry Standard</h3>
<ol>
<li>The industry as a whole increasingly employs consumer-hostile practices in its publication and distribution, such as: <br>
  <a href="harmful_practices.html#artificial_exclusivity">artificial exclusivity</a>,
  <a href="harmful_practices.html#centralized_servers">centralized multiplayer servers</a>,
  <a href="harmful_practices.html#DRM">DRM</a>,
  <a href="harmful_practices.html#exclusive_content">exclusive content and pre-order bonuses</a>,
  <a href="harmful_practices.html#backwards_compatability">limited backwards compatibility</a>,
  <a href="harmful_practices.html#modding_hostility">Hostility to Modding</h3>,
  <a href="harmful_practices.html#LAN">no LAN multiplayer</a>,
  <a href="harmful_practices.html#splitscreen">no split-screen</a>,
  <a href="harmful_practices.html#online_subscription">console online subscriptions</a>,
  <a href="harmful_practices.html#P2W">P2W and microtranscation models</a>,
  <a href="harmful_practices.html#DLC">paid DLC</a>,
  <a href="harmful_practices.html#subscription">subscription releases or seasonal passes</a> and
  <a href="harmful_practices.html#vendor_lockin">vendor lock-in</a>.
</li>
<li>Even the <a href="http://archive.is/3lTYW" title="Jesper Juul, 'High-tech Low-tech Authenticity: The Creation of Independent Style at the Independent Games Festival'">indie industry</a>, which has heavily commercialized over the last decade, has begun to adopt some questionable practices, such as:<br>
  <a href="harmful_practices.html#closed_source">closed source & non-free software</a>,
  <a href="harmful_practices.html#early_access">early access</a>,
  <a href="harmful_practices.html#crowdfunding">crowdfunding</a> and
  <a href="harmful_practices.html#paywall">paywalled content</a>.
</li>
<li>It is uncomfortable to participate in and unethical to support this industry, and it will only change when consumers as a group <a href="">reject it</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a id="good_games_dont_age"></a>4. Good Games Don’t Age</h3>
<ol>
  <li><a href="http://archive.is/fiShb" title="Resetera Forum Discussion, 'Truly Great Gameplay Does Not Age.'">Good game design is eternal</a>. The best games of the past are all just as rewarding to play today as they were at their release. This is evidenced by the common practice of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_remakes_and_remastered_ports" title="Wikipedia, List of video game remakes and remastered ports">rereleasing older games</a>.</li>
  <li>Innovation in game design is less and less tied to <a href="http://archive.is/vKBRY" title="Jim Rossignol, 'Photorealism And The Confusing Myths Of Innovation'">innovation in technology</a>. Any game made today could easily have been made 10 years ago once we discount graphics.</li>

<li>In the long-term, games are evaluated on the merits of their <a href="">game design</a>, while the technical achievement of their graphics become <a href="http://archive.is/vKBRY" title="Jim Rossignol, 'Photorealism And The Confusing Myths Of Innovation'">irrelevant</a>.</li>
<li>The near-complete <a href="http://archive.is/Yg6sV" title="NonMAME Emulator Guide">historical library of video games</a> is <!--<a href="https://vimm.net/?p=vault">free</a> and -->readily accessible through <a href="https://www.retroarch.com">emulation</a>. A lifetime isn't enough to exhaust the long list of <a href="https://vsrecommendedgames.fandom.com/wiki/V/%27s_Recommended_Games_Wiki" title="/v/'s Recommended Games Wiki'">highly regarded games</a>.</li>

<li>The majority of games of every generation <a href="http://archive.is/rahBp" title="Wikipedia, 'Sturgeon's Law'">will be forgettable</a>, and conversely, only the worthwhile ones will be remembered. There is little reason to bother sifting through today's trash when you can play yesterday's gems.</li>

<p></p>
<h2><a id="manifesto"></a>Manifesto</h2>
<man>
<p>1. Reject graphical quality as an influence on your interpretation of a game’s value.</p>
<p>2. Reject any game that cannot be played on inexpensive hardware.</p>
<p>3. Reject any game that is designed or released with harmful practices.</p>
<p>4. Configure your system(s) to make full use of the emulation options available.</p>
<p>5. Consider all new games released today alongside all games released in the past, not only in the isolated context of their own generation.</p>
<p>6. Consider all new games released today from a long-term perspective. Ask yourself: In 20 years, would I choose to play this game, or the 40 year old one?</p>
